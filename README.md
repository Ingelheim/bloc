# Hello, new student!

I started taking these notes to try to improve the onboarding process. As the length of this document has grown, I found I was spending the entire first appointment just reading these notes. My goal with this online version is to give you an opportunity to learn about my personal approach to Bloc mentoring while also freeing us up to establish our workflow from Day 1. Please read carefully through all of this ahead of our first appointment.

> Please note: this is a supplement and not a replacement for Bloc’s onboarding resources and [incubation materials](https://www.bloc.io/resources/frontend-prework).

## About Me

Hopefully, you’ve already read [my Bloc mentor profile](https://www.bloc.io/mentors/lukas-ingelheim). If you have more questions, don’t be afraid to ask! We will definitely get to know each other throughout our time together.

## Pacing

![Monsters University slug running](http://media.giphy.com/media/1KJPg114jm68U/giphy.gif)

Bloc breaks up the front end curriculum into two main parts: foundations and project. Even though you need only 2 projects to graduate, I will push you to do at least a couple or projects more. All of the pacing information and notifications provided by Bloc are based on this, but it doesn’t necessarily account for time needed for additional assignments, projects, or portfolio and/or blog work. To accommodate this, I push each of my students toward a slightly more aggressive pacing.

> *Note: Not all checkpoints are created equal. Some checkpoints take minutes, some take hours, and a few might take days. The idea is to keep a steady pace and learn how to independently solve problems to keep moving when you hit a wall.*

## Scheduling Flexibility

I currently work full-time hours Monday through Friday, and I try to do as many appointments as possible in the afternoons and after work. That said, I can typically move appointments as needed throughout the day as long as I am on top of my work responsibilities for that day. As I am located in Berlin, Germany, I am mostly available in the mornings - early afternoons if you happen to be located in North America.

In the past, I have had to reschedule some appointments due to vacation and travel. I will be sure to give you a heads up at least a week in advance so we can either do a couple longer appointments or reschedule for another day.

## Appointment Expectations

#### Screenhero

I am very much a proponent of learning by doing, so my goal is to do as much pair programming as possible in each appointment. This is where the [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com) app really shines. The video and audio quality are much more reliable than any other tool I’ve used including Google Hangouts, Mac screensharing, Skype, or GoToMeeting. If you haven’t already downloaded [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com) or are unable to do so, I will send you an invite to whichever email you have associated to your Bloc account.

#### 30 Minutes

Bloc does a good job explaining why it’s important to use our time wisely and to be strict about our start and end time. This is real world after all. The truth is, 30 minutes goes by quickly and **we will run out of time**. When this happens, follow these steps to try to solve the problem on your own:

1. Flex your debugging muscle. (_[more on this below](#debugging)_)
2. Search for your issue on [Stack Overflow](https://blog.bloc.io/using-stack-overflow-like-pro) and [Google](https://google.com).
3. Join the [student Slack channel](https://bloc-students.slack.com) and ask your question there.
4. Watch the solution video at the end of the checkpoint.
5. [Send me an email](lukas.ingelheim@gmail.com) or message on Bloc before our next appointment with links to code that shows me what you have tried, and I’ll try my best to help you resolve any blockers so we don’t burn through more appointment time.

## Submissions

At bare minimum, Bloc requires a link to your code for each submission. For checkpoints with assignments, you should include at least 2 links. Any additional information you can provide in the comment portion of your submission or as part of the discussion for that checkpoint will help me better understand your progress. Consider the following:

#### Describe the Vibe

- How did it feel to work on this?
- Overwhelming or pretty straightforward?
- Completely foreign or somewhat intuitive?

#### Blockers

- Was there anything specific that I got hung up on?
- I spent a lot of time on this thing that was actually pretty simple once I figured it out.
- I’m still blocked + I can’t move on until I get this resolved. **Help!**

#### Overachiever

- While completing this assignment, I came across these other tools or resources that are really interesting.
- There were additional challenges for this assignment and I attempted it but did not complete it.
- I completed all of the additional challenges. (and then some!)

None of this is required, but again, any additional information you provide will help me determine where we need to spend more time and how we can adjust our focus.

## Debugging

![Andy Samberg confused](http://i.giphy.com/3oEdvczpwpfwy2aTJK.gif)

Debugging will be your most valuable skill as you grow in self-sufficiency and independence as a programmer. Sometimes you’ll have an error message as a starting point, but many times you won’t, so it’s important to start developing your sense for where to start and which questions to ask. Being able to unblock yourself will free us up to dig deeper during our appointments.

I would be happy to give you live examples of this during our first appointment, but know this will come up regularly during pair programming.

## Foundations Overview

This may not make much sense if your roadmap hasn’t unlocked yet. Let's talk what is ahead the comings months and especially the coming weeks in our first meeting.

## Projects

We will worry about this more as we get closer to completing Foundations. Projects are pretty much real applications where you will work on your Rails and front-end skills through learning by doing. You will have a lot of fun and also learn a lot while doing so.

## That’s it! :thumbsup:

Thanks for taking the time to read all that, and I hope it wasn’t overwhelming. I consider mentoring a great privilege because it helps me learn and grow as well. **Everyone wins.** It for that reason that I am looking forward to our time together! Talk to you soon.

Cheers,

_Lukas_
